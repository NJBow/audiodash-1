AudioDash

AudioDash is 3D video game which interacts with its soundtrack. The player can choose a level where they control either a horse, spaceship, fishing boat, or a peculiar cube thing to try avoid varying obstacles. The objective is to utilise the four lanes and make it to the end without hitting anything, (the cube has 16 lanes).

The different controllable characters are specific to their surroundings and difficulty level. The horse is easy and travelling to the big city. The spaceship is medium and lost in space wondering why there is a dancing whale. The fishing boat is hard and enjoying the scenery. The cube is insane, with 16 lanes and has no idea what's going on.

The Audio

The idea of the audio is that it can be used to define and interact with the gaming environment. This is best seen if you can get past 16 seconds on the insane level. With the links below we have two options. The first is a downloadable version of the game which has the audio interacting with the game, however it requires security permissions to download as it is an unrecognised app for a mac. The second option is to play online however the audio doesn't interact with the game, this is currently being discussed with the hosting provider.

The Technologies

This game is built using Unity 3D engine, Unity Test Tools and C# scripting language.
