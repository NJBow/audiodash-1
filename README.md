# AudioDash
This repository contains the scripts used to run AudioDash.

AudioDash is a infinite style runner game where the player dodges past objects
with the objective of getting as far as possible.

The first 3 levels are not inifinte and could almost be considered as practice,
but the final "insane" level is and has a counter to show your survival time.

Some aspects of the game are manipulated by the music, this is more visible on 
the medium and insane levels.

The best representation of this manipulation can be seen at 16 seconds into
the insane level.

The insane level, as well as being infinite, also has the feature of 16 lane
positions rather than the normal 4 in previous levels.

If you feel like challenging yourself you can attempt to play the game only
on the side or maybe on the top 4 lanes.

Below are some screenshots showing off each level, the start and pause menu.
